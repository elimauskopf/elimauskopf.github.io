                My name is Eli Mauskopf and I am an experienced developer
                looking for the next challenge in my career. I am a software
                engineer with several years of experience currently teaching myself
                game development. Growing up, gaming has always been an integral part
                of my life. Many of the games I played had a profound impact on my life
                and presented challenging and thoughtful gameplay that I admired. Since
                I was little I knew making games was something I wanted to do.
                I am interested in creating satisfying and unique
                virtual experiences as I continue on this path.
