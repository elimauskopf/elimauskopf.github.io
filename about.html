                Eli Mauskopf is an experienced software engineer based in Philadelphia, PA
                and graduated from Bucknell University with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2020.
                 While working in web development after graduating was sustainable and surely a 
                 knowledge-boosting experience, he longed for the same enjoyment that he got 
                 from gaming after a long day of work, and felt a need to learn the tools
                  necessary to start making his own experiences. A lifelong gamer and
                   lover of difficult, substantive, and humorous games, Eli has managed
                    to put together a few short projects that are fun, challenging, and
                    fit the mold of his style and vision. Over the past year, Eli has been
                    developing Slaughter Void, his largest project yet, which he hopes to release in early 2026.
